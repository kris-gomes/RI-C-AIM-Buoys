R scripts used for the processing and QC of data from buoy platforms in Narragansett Bay as part of RI-CAIM. 

QC checks are being performed following recommended guidelines from the Ocean Observatories Initiative (https://oceanobservatories.org/quality-control/) and will be added to appropriate R files as they are implemented. 


"bouy_hydrocat_deployment_qc.rmd" is an R markdown file for the QC and plotting of data from Seabird Hydrocat-EP sensor system. An example Hydrocat data file is provided as well as local^ (NB_PhysicalData_8.10.20201.csv) and global^^ (data_qc_global_range_values.csv) range datasets for QC tests.
